# Vision
The present work presents the application of computer vision techniques for inspection and detection of defects on the surface of laminated steel sheets, seeking to provide a better quality in the final product. For this application, a camera was used to acquire images of the surface of the laminated sheet. Through these images, the techniques developed identify possible defects or nonconformities and allow the operator to be alerted about possible defects. These techniques were implemented with the help of the OpenCV library, IDE Qt Creator in the linux operating system.
